# STS 2 Unlimited

Play **Slay the Spire 2** multiplayer with any number of players. The vanilla game caps lobbies at 4; this mod removes that limit and lets you configure it from the in-game settings menu.

## Installation

1. Download `Sts2Unlimited.zip` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest)
2. Extract all files into your Slay the Spire 2 `mods/` folder:
   ```
   mods/
   └── Sts2Unlimited/
       ├── sts2unlimited.dll
       ├── 0Harmony.dll
       ├── sts2unlimited.pck
       ├── mod_manifest.json
       ├── icon.svg
       └── sts2unlimited.maxplayers.txt
   ```
3. Launch the game — the mod loads automatically

## Configuration

The easiest way is the **in-game settings menu**: open Settings and use the "Max Players" slider (range: 2–256). Changes save automatically.

Alternatively, edit `sts2unlimited.maxplayers.txt` in the mods folder and restart the game. The default is **8 players**.

## How It Works

The game's networking layer already supports arbitrary player counts — the limit is enforced entirely by hardcoded `4` values at the lobby initialization sites. This mod uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to prefix-patch those methods and substitute the configured value:

| Patched Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NetHostGameService.StartSteamHost()` | Steam lobby creation |
| `NetHostGameService.StartENetHost()` | ENet (direct IP) lobby creation |
| `NCharacterSelectScreen.InitializeMultiplayerAsHost()` | Standard run lobby |
| `NCustomRunScreen.InitializeMultiplayerAsHost()` | Custom run lobby |

Settings are persisted to `sts2unlimited.settings.json` via the game's own settings API, with fallback to the legacy text file.

## Limitations

- UI screens (character select, etc.) may feel crowded with many players
- Game balance is tuned for 4 players; behavior beyond that is untested
- Steam lobby size limits may apply regardless of this mod's setting

## Building from Source

Requires .NET 9 and the `sts2.dll` game reference assembly placed in the project root.

```bash
dotnet build --configuration ExportRelease
```

Output is bundled to `release/` by the `BundleRelease` MSBuild target.
